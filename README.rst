``clippercard`` is an unofficial web API to clippercard.com, written in Python.

Not only is the `clippercard web site <https://www.clippercard.com>`_ a total UX/UI disaster, its behind-the-scene's HTML structure and HTTP protocol is a complete exercise in palmface. This library aims to provide an unofficial but sensible interface to the official web service.

Note: I love the actual usage of ClipperCard on buses and trains, my complaints about the service is purely isolated to its web interface. I saw a problem, and I solved it for myself, that's all.

Features
--------

- Profile Data
- Multiple cards' data
- For each card, multiple products and balances

I don't have access to all products loadable on the ClipperCard, so transit agency support is limited to what I personally use for now. If you'd like me to add support for your product, send me the page source from your `account home page <https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperCard/dashboard.jsf>`_

Installation
------------

To install clippercard, simply:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install clippercard

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    import clippercard
    session = clippercard.Session(<username>, <password>)
    print(session.user_profile)
    for c in session.cards:
        print(c)


You also get a super convenient command line binary ``clippercard``::


    $ clippercard -h # see usage information

    $ clippercard summary

If you wish to use clippercard without specifying username/password on the CLI, create a file ``~/.clippercardrc`` with this format::

    [default]
    username = <replace_with_your_email>
    password = <replace_with_your_password>

You may toggle accounts via the ``--account`` flag on the command line to access one of several configs in the file::

    [default]
    username = <replace_with_your_email>
    password = <replace_with_your_password>
    
    [wife]
    username = <replace_with_login_email>
    password = <replace_with_login_password>
    
The ``wife`` credentials can then be accessed via::

    $ clippercard summary --account=wife
